# Differences from original HVM:

* Haxelib version management is removed, this repo uses the Haxelib packaged with the Haxe installaiton
* Neko 2.1.0 has been added
* Running hvm does not require sudo (just removing your non-hvm install)
* Paths in this readme were updated to include /usr/local/.., though depending on your system this may not apply

# Installation:

If you have an existing Haxe install, you will need to nuke it from orbit:

```shell
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/haxe
sudo rm -rf /usr/loca/lib/neko
sudo rm /usr/local/lib/libneko.dylib
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/haxe*
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/neko*
```

And then:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/iv247/hvm.git ~/.hvm
echo "source ~/.hvm/hvm.sh" >> ~/.profile
source ~/.profile
hvm install
```

# What does it do?

Running `hvm install` creates these symlinks:

```shell
sudo ln -sf ~/.hvm/haxe.sh /usr/local/bin/haxe
sudo ln -sf ~/.hvm/haxelib.sh /usr/local/bin/haxelib
sudo ln -sf ~/.hvm/neko.sh /usr/local/bin/neko
sudo ln -sf ~/.hvm/nekotools.sh /usr/local/bin/nekotools
sudo ln -sf ~/.hvm/nekoc.sh /usr/local/bin/nekoc
sudo ln -sf ~/.hvm/nekoml.sh /usr/local/bin/nekoml
```

Each of those scripts sources `config.sh`, which figures out which binary to use.

The config sources `~/.hvm/versions.sh`, then `~/.hvm/current.sh` and then `./hvmrc` if it exists. The first defines default versions, the second defines the currently selected global versions (as set with `hvm use`) and the third allows projects to specify specific versions to use.

The config script uses the versions to determine the path to the right install, located in `~/.hvm/versions/$(neko|haxe|haxelib)/$version`. If that path does not exist, hvm will install it.

Stable versions of Neko are installed from the [here](http://nekovm.org/download) while dev versions are installed from [here](http://hxbuilds.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/builds/neko/mac/).

Stable versions of Haxe are installed from the [here](http://old.haxe.org/file/) while dev versions are installed from [here](http://hxbuilds.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/builds/haxe/mac/).

Stable versions of Haxelib are installed from the [here](http://lib.haxe.org/p/haxelib_client) while dev versions are installed from [here](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxelib).

To set the current global version in `~/.hvm/current.sh`, run:

```shell
hvm use $tool $version
```

Where `$tool` is one of `neko`, `haxe` or `haxelib` and `$version` is either `dev` for the latest development release, or a released version. An error will be printed if you specify a version that does not exist.

If you run `hvm use $tool latest` the currently installed `dev` version of `$tool` will be reinstalled to ensure you are running the most recent dev release.

# Important notes

The 2.0.0 OS X release of Neko on http://nekovm.org is built for 32 bit. The Haxe compiler uses Neko shared libraries for certain kinds of Regex matching at macro time. However, stable Haxe releases for OS X are now 64bit (since 3.0.0) meaning this bridging is not possible with the 2.0.0 release of Neko. For this reason it is recommended to use the `dev` version of Neko with Haxe 3.x releases (this is the default in `~/.hvm/versions.sh`)

Complicating matters further, before Haxe 3.0.0 Haxelib was distributed as a compiled 32bit Neko binary, so Haxe 2.x releases will not work with Neko `dev`. For this reason you will need to use a stable release of Neko with 2.x releases of Haxe.

Simple, really.
